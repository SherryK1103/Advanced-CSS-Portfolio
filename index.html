        <h4>Work History</h4>
        <p>
          I have an eclectic work history ranging from nannying to the
          automotive industry. The most interesting job I have ever had is the
          role of Private Investigator. I was the Manager of Special
          Investigations at MSI Detective Services in the City of Chicago for 5
          years. My work primarily consisted of inside investigations;
          coordinating field work and conducting background, locate, and asset
          investigations. I have quite a few stories!

        <h4>My Coding Journey</h4>
        <p>
          The coding seed was planted in my mind a while back when I
          receptionist at a scale company in 2008. I was tasked with utilizing
          Excel for tracking sales leads and other data. I learned how to record
          macros and use formulas, I became obsessed. I would even record macros
          and do formulas in Excel at home, on my own time. But never thinking
          of myself as a <strong>computer person</strong>, so this would lay
          dormant in my mind for nearly a decade. Fast forward to 2020, working
          at a collections agency I overeheard a colleague say that writing
          formulas in Excel is like the very beginning of coding. I was
          immediately intrigued. I surfed the internet and saw many people
          talking on social media about how they changed their careers by
          learning how to code.

        <h4>SEO HTML Refactor</h4>
        <p>
          The SEO HTML Refactor assignment was my first project at the
          NorthWestern University Coding Bootcamp. We were given a webpage with
          code and were charged with consolidating redundant code, changing it
          from non-semantic elements to semantic elements to improve SEO as well
          as comply with AAA standards. This assignment displayed the skills I
          had learned in HTML and CSS.
